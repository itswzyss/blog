# So I took a bit of a hiatus.
Maybe you noticed, maybe you didn't. In any case, I haven't published anything here on my blog since ~2023. Now that we're diving head-first into 2025, I thought I should pick things back up here again.

Here soon I'll be making new posts about how I have my homelab set up. I might cover things like Proxmox, how I have my systems configured with my UPS and all that fun stuff. I'm thinking perhaps I'll even get into making a post about Caddy (my new favorite webserver).

So stay a while, I look forward to making these new posts and hearing your thoughts on them.
