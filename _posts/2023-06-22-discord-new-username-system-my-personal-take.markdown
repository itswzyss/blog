## Introduction

You and I both know what this is about. Recently, <a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank">Discord</a>, dropped a bombshell announcement about changing its username system. Now, I know this change has sparked some mixed reactions among users, with some showing support and others voicing their complaints. In this post, I want to take a moment to express my personal support for this changte and explain why I believe it's a step in the right direction.

## The Hassle of Discriminators

To begin with, let's talk about the hassle of discriminators, the four-digit numbers that used to accompany our usernames. The new system is removing them entirely. And honestly, I couldn't be happier about it. Why? It's simple: it will make finding friends a whole lot easier. With the old system, it was difficult to track down the right user when two people had the same username but different discriminators. It was almost impossible to add friends based soley on username. The new system eliminates this problem entirely. Now, we use our unique usernames, like "wzyss," making it so much easier to remember and share.

## Username Restrictions

Let's address the headache of searching for usernames with special unicode text. In the past, if you needed to find a user with a name containing those special unicode characters, it meant copying and pasting their username. If you were unable to copy and paste, good luck. I've personally ran ito many such cases where I had to have someone add me because they had random symbols in their name. With the new username system, you are limited to creating usernames with standard letters, numbers, underscores and periods. None of that other mumbo jumbo.

## Conclusion

Coming to a close, I believe that the changes Discord has made to its username system are undoubtedly a positive move. Not only does the username system operate like every other major platform now, but it is also just so much easier to use. Forget special characters, symbols and all that nonsense.
