# Hi, I'm Wzyss! âœ¨
Just your local internet dogo. And yes, if you weren't already aware, I'm a bit of a furry.

I am:
- a proud furry
- a "home-labber"
- the local tech genius (they said it, not me)

## What I Do
I do _loads_ of random things. If it has something to do with computers, I'm probably into it.

Right now I'm on a frenzy of self-hosting various websites and services. For example I selfhost things like:
- Vaultwarden (Unofficial Bitwarden server rewritten in Rust)
- Various Discord bots
- Nextcloud (Personal cloud solution)
- Numerous game servers

## What I Like
- Computers & Hardware
- Networking (Especially UniFi stuff)
- Gold ðŸ’›
- German Shepherds

## What I Don't Like
- Self-proclaimed "know it alls"
- Gatekeeping
- Being an asshole
